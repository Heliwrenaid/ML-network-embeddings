# Network Embeddings

This a school project realized for the needs of Machine Learning Course at AGH University of Science and Technology. The main purpose of the project is to examine network data representation with the use of network embeddings.

###### New contributions were added to the project in the following order:
1. Get acquainted with the subject of Network Embeddings
2. Configure appropriate cloud environment (Google Colab and Github)
3. Use Node2Vec algorithm to create network embeddings
4. Use t-SNE to reduce number of dimensions in received embeddings
5. Visualize data using proper python libraries
6. Examine properties of other embedding algorithms (LINE, Deepwalk, SDNE, Struct2Vec)
7. Customize Node2Vec implementation to test various scenarios
8. Predict the link type based on embeddings
9. Combine link prediction with algorithm comparison
10. Examine how embedding vector size impacts link prediction
